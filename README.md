## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a Rocket web framework skeleton that you can work with.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement a feature: `Notification`.
This feature will receive notifications of creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, when this receiver instance is subscribed to a certain product type.
The notification will be sent using HTTP POST request, so you need to make the receiver endpoint in this project.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Receiver" folder.

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    ROCKET_PORT=8001
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:${ROCKET_PORT}
    APP_PUBLISHER_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8000
    APP_INSTANCE_NAME=Safira Sudrajat
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable                | type   | description                                                     |
    |-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ROCKET_PORT             | string | Port number that will be listened by this receiver instance.    |
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL   | string | URL address where this receiver instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_PUUBLISHER_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where the publisher instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_INSTANCE_NAME       | string | Name of this receiver instance, will be shown on notifications. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)
3.  To simulate multiple instances of BambangShop Receiver (as the tutorial mandates you to do so),
    you can open new terminal, then edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` file, then execute another `cargo run`.

    For example, if you want to run 3 (three) instances of BambangShop Receiver at port `8001`, `8002`, and `8003`, you can do these steps:
    -   Edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8001`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8002`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open another new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8003`, then execute `cargo run`.

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Subscriber) Reflections

#### Reflection Subscriber-1

1. We use RwLock, instead of Mutex, because we expect the frequency of reads to be a lot higher than writes, since we would expect many users trying to read the notifications at the same time, so many concurrent reads will occur, while writes should only occur whenever a change is recieved from the publisher. The reason that RwLock is better than Mutex in such scenarios, because it will allow multiple concurrent reads to happen at a time, while still providing thread safety, by making sure that when a write happens, no reads or writes can happen at the same time, whereas Mutex will lock the Vector and prevent access, if any other thread is currently writing OR reading to the Vector, thus disallowing concurrent reads (since with Mutex, even reads will make it so other threads can't access the Vector until the read is done).


2. Rust's philosophy is that they force programmers to correctly handle problems such as memory safety, handling race conditions and defining behaviour in multi-threaded environments in their code, otherwise the code won't compile. This is as opposed to Java, where such issues don't immediately stop compilation, thus possible logical errors that are more difficult to identify than compile errors may occur. In support of Rust's philosophy, all multi-threaded memory accesses is based on the idea of ownership (to a thread), borrowing and mutability, to ensure programs being made in Rust are memory safe. Lazy_static is a library that uses mutability to access data from a static object, that ensures that locks are in place on access (or just on write if you're using RwLock), which would provide memory safety and defines behaviour in multi-threaded environments. This is opposed to Java letting you use static functions to access the data, where nothing is stopping programmers from introducing buggy code that may cause data races and improper access of shared resources. If Rust were to allow us to access static variables by just making the functions static, it will go against Rust's philosophy of forcing programmers to code in a way that is memory safe and doesn't allow for ambiguous/messy behaviour. Hence why such 'fixes' are disallowed in Rust.
